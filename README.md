# **Accessibility test cases**

Demo version: http://russmaxdesign.github.io/Accessibility-test-cases/

This is a set of simple test files to show how screen readers such as JAWS and NVDA operate when dealing with basic HTML elements and ARIA attributes. There are also a range of simple keyboard only tests.

Any other suggestions or comments are welcome!
