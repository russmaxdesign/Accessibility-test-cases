	<div id="message" class="warning" aria-live="polite"></div>
	
	<p>
			It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age 
			of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, 
			it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was 
			the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter 
			of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, 
			we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the 
			other way &#x2014; in short, the period was so far like the present 
			period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being 
			received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of 
			comparison only.
